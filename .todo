Project (Ordered by priority):
	Scope:
		Maybe change the layout to a grid layout, using vertical cards with actions on the bottom.
		Also the slider could be vertical on the right side of the cards.

	Next steps:
		✔ Start using zustand for state management. @done(21-05-04 20:07)
		✔ Add alerts @done(21-05-06 22:30)
		✔ Add the wish form and states. @done(21-05-11 12:54)
		☐ Finish new wallet layout.
		☐ Add edit wallet functionality.
		✔ Add wallet deposit and withdraw. @done(21-05-17 18:08)
		☐ Change wallet actions layout?
		☐ Add environment variables to add the api url there and actually commit all this work. @est(1h)
		☐ Cleanup wallet form component and state.
		☐ Better the whole page layout.
		☐ Create a simple search bar and filtered wishes state.
		☐ Create a wallet form right below the wallet to edit the amount of a wallet.
		Use a transition to grow a form right below the wallet with an
		input and a button. Maybe use small buttons on top of each other to
		represent put and take directions (green and red arrows) and a save button.
		☐ Remove float numbers, use only integers @est(1h)
		This is already applied to some components, might revert these or update the rest.

	
	Bug:
		✔ Alerts are positioned absolute, and should be sticky so they don't move when scrolling. @done(21-05-17 18:16)
		✔ Fix wish slider and wallet amount, find way to make it reliable and dynamic. @done(21-05-09 19:05)
		☐ Fix error boundary to catch errors like network erros and such.
		☐ Fix progress bar's border radius.
		It always has a border on the right, and should only have one if it's maxed.
		✔ Find a way to set a wallet as active when the app loads. @done(21-05-09 19:05)

	Cleanup:
		☐ Start using Typographys and Boxs from material to keep UI concise.
		✔ borderSmall -> make it part of the material theme. @done(21-05-11 18:01)
